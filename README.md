# Policing data analysis and visulization for Champaign County
This project is aiming to gather and organize the policing data in different jurisdiction of Champaign County and provide suitable visulization for the public to understand the trends and amounts of arrests happened in the county from 2010 to 2016.
The project page mainly consists of two parts: Data and Application.
##Data
This application provides tools to visualize characteristics of the arrested population in Champaign and Urbana from January 2010 to October 2016. Data for these tools come from the police departments in Champaign, Urbana, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Arrests include police incidents in which an individual is charged with a violation of the law. This means the arrest data includes data for individuals who were issued citations and traffic tickets, along with individuals who were charged with more serious crimes.
